          <h4>A brutal clash</h4>
          Anyone near Clemenceau Avenue, Penang Road on May 13 > would have seen
          a violent clash outside. This was the tragic National Service Riot,
          which saw 26 people injured. Students from Chung Cheng High (中正高)
          and Chinese High School (南洋华侨中学) simply wanted their voices to
          be heard by the British Administration, but the police handled the
          students with unreasonable and unforgivable violence.

        <div class="item3">
          <h4>A poorly handled situation</h4>
          The riot police’s and the government’s handling of the students were
          both unacceptable, without which, this fateful event could have been
          avoided. The students felt that they were being unfairly treated by
          the British, and wanted to have a voice in the matter.
        </div>
        <div class="item4">
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
          To understand the cause of the riots, we must look at the National
          Service Ordinance, which is a policy recently implemented, requiring
          all men aged 18 to 20 to serve in the military. The government’s
          reason for this policy: a capable defence force would be needed in a
          country seeking self-government.
        </div>
        <div class="item5">
          The government ignoring the students caused a detrimental lack of
          communication which only exacerbated this feeling. The students got
          increasingly desperate and eventually felt that they needed to protest
          to get themselves a voice. This might be seen as a radical decision,
          but we must acknowledge that the government’s negligence was a leading
          cause for this.
        </div>
        <div class="item6">
          <h4>A confrontation of logic</h4>
          However, the Chinese community was against this decision as not only
          did it interfere with the students’ education opportunities, but also
          went against the traditional Chinese belief that good men do not
          become soldiers. One cannot ignore the fact that throughout
          Singapore’s history as a British colony, the Chinese community and
          culture were constantly treated as relatively unimportant by the
          British. As such, many Chinese did not want to fight for and serve
          them.
        </div>
        <div class="item7">
           <p> A chaotic scene where the police can be seen capturing Chinese protesters and tying them up with ropes. The text reads (translated from Chinese): They are going to kill us with the rough and big ropes they use to capture us with.</p>
          </br>
          <h4>From peace to protests</h4>
          The students of Chung Cheng High and Chinese High School had tried to
          submit separate petitions to the government. These petitions had all
          their reasons, along with a peaceful request for exemption from
          National Service. Unfortunately, these petitions ended up getting
          ignored by the government.
        </div>
        <div class="item8">
          The riot police, on the other hand, made decisions that were frankly
          uncalled for. They gave the students a few warnings before engaging
          them with force. We must not forget that these are young boys and
          girls who were peacefully protesting. While this may be a protocol to
          use in the case of a violent and aggressive mob, engaging these
          innocent students who had no intention of violence was unnecessary and
          added fuel to the fire.
        </div>
        <div class="item9">
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
          Furthermore, a lack of information on National Service caused many to
          speculate that they would be conscripted to fight in Malayan jungles
          for the British. Both parties had acceptable reasons for their
          attitudes towards the National Service Ordinance, so this conflict was
          avoidable. Who, then, was truly at fault for this needless suffering?
          We should first understand the rest of the events.
        </div>
        <div class="item10">
          <h4>Learning points</h4>
          All in all, if the riot police had not been so quick to attack the
          students, this violence could have been easily avoided. The government
          and the police had the power to peacefully resolve this issue, but did
          not. Now, blood has been needlessly shed, the problem has been
          exacerbated and we can expect even more riots. The authorities should
          change their perception of students and treat them with more respect
          if they want to avoid catastrophes like these.
        </div>
        <div class="item11">
        </br>
          On 13 May, the students assembled on Clemenceau Avenue to protest.
          After their petitions got rejected, they felt that they needed their
          voices heard somehow, and therefore simply started a peaceful protest.
          The government once again ignored their pleas and the riot police were
          deployed. After a few warnings, they resorted to force to disperse the
          students. Students who marched up to Penang Road just to show moral
          support were handled the same way. As a result, 20 students and 6
          police officers were injured.
